# Advanced SQL Project: Digital Music Store Analysis

The `analysis.sql` file contains a series of 6 queries written to analyze the "Chinook" sample database. The queries answer real-world business questions and progress in complexity, from basic `JOINs` to advanced `CTEs` and `Window Functions`.

## Queries Included:

* **Task 1 & 2:** Basic `JOINs` to find customers and tracks by artist.
* **Task 3 & 4:** `GROUP BY` and `SUM()` to find the top-selling genres and the top-performing employee.
* **Task 5:** A `LEFT JOIN...IS NULL` query to find all inventory (tracks) that has never been purchased.
* **Task 6:** An advanced `CTE` and `Window Function (RANK())` query to find the most valuable customer in each country.
